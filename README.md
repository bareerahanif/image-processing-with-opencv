# image-processing-with-opencv
This project involves implementing various image processing tasks using the OpenCV library in Python. You'll start by loading an image into an OpenCV Mat variable and displaying it as a grayscale image. Then, you'll convert the Mat variable into a dynamic integer array for further manipulation.
