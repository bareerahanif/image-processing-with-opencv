# Image Processing with OpenCV

## Description
This project involves implementing various image processing tasks using the OpenCV library in Python. You'll start by loading an image into an OpenCV Mat variable and displaying it as a grayscale image. Then, you'll convert the Mat variable into a dynamic integer array for further manipulation.

## Problems
### Problem 1:
Load an image in OpenCV Mat variable as a grayscale image and display it in a window.

### Problem 2:
Convert the Mat variable to a dynamic integer array and perform the following operations:

- **A.** Binarize the image (pixels should have two possible values) and display it.
- **B.** Crop the image according to given coordinates (x, y) and dimensions (height, width). Display the cropped image.
- **C.** Modify the image to have 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 possible values. Display the resulting images.

## Bonus Problem:
Rotate the image by 90 and 180 degrees. Display the rotated images.
